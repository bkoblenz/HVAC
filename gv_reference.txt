radiost number of radio stations (included in nst count)

for logging:
lg:0 log runs if = "checked"
lr:100 limit number of log records to keep, 0 = no limit

for substations:
master:0 this station is operating as a master
slave:0 this station is operating as a slave
master_ip:'' ip address of master (only valid if slave != 0
